## Kelsie's Section
This is me messing around. I hope it breaks! If not, that's okay. It will just take the fun out of it, though.

I am going to continue typing to make a really long readme file. Adding new lines are super fun and easy! 

## Poems
Violets, I hold you
Sweet within my hand.
Whisper what he told you
In the sunset land.
Violets, my spirit
Feels what you intend.
In my soul I hear it:
"Think upon thy friend."
New line from Brian

## Alaina's section
This is a short section I'm adding to the repository!
I'm excited to learn how to use git with multiple people editing different branches.
